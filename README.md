`Integrating the Paystack payment gateway with a Spring Boot application involves a few steps. 
Paystack provides APIs that you can use to interact with their payment system. 
Here's a general outline of how you can integrate Paystack into your Spring Boot application:`

Sign Up and Get API Keys:
Start by signing up on the Paystack platform to get your API keys. 
You'll need both the test and live API keys for development and production environments respectively.

Create Payment Request Endpoint:
Create a REST endpoint in your Spring Boot application to initiate a payment request. 
This endpoint will generate a payment URL and return it to the client.

Handle Webhooks:
Paystack sends webhook events to your application to notify about payment status changes. 
Implement endpoints to handle these webhook events and update your application accordingly.

Implement Paystack API Calls:
Use HTTP client libraries (like RestTemplate or WebClient) in Spring Boot to make requests to Paystack's APIs. 
You'll use these calls to create transactions, verify payments, and handle other payment-related tasks.
